				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Toyota debuted the production tC at the January 2004 NAIAS with sales beginning in August 2004 as a 2005 model year. The tC is a spiritual successor to the Celica in order to appeal to the Millennial market.
					Toyota hoped to do so by making standard features numerous and optional features extremely easy to add as well as giving the car a sporty flair. The Scion tC shares its chassis with the Avensis and uses a
					MacPherson strut front and double wishbone rear suspension. Its low price (base MSRP of US$17,670 for the 2009 model with manual transmission) is a major feature, as well as the pure "monospec" pricing marketing
					style that Toyota has adopted. This generation was not sold in Canada. Standard equipment included power windows, cruise control, air conditioning, keyless entry, mirror-mounted turn signal lights, four-wheel
					anti-lock disc brakes, a 160-watt Pioneer sound system with CD player, 17-inch alloy wheels, and a panoramic moonroof. The tC received a minor facelift in 2007 for the 2008 model year that included a revised
					grille and new head and taillights. A bare-bones version of the Scion tC known as the Spec Package was offered without many of the standard accessories. The Scion tC Spec Package replaces the 17-inch (430 mm)
					alloy wheels with 16-inch (410 mm) steel wheels and seven spoke wheel covers. The glass roof is fixed in place and the steering wheel is made of urethane instead of wrapped leather and lacks stereo controls;
					cruise control is also not offered and many other minor interior and exterior changes. This model, which is meant to serve as a blank slate to the tuner market, was offered in only four colors: Super White,
					Flint Mica, Black Sand Pearl and Classic Silver Metallic. MSRP was $1,400 less than the standard model. The Spec Package was discontinued for the 2009 model year.  The model was Scion's best seller, reaching
					over 79,125 units sold in 2006,[9] but the car's sales quickly dwindled by 2010, only moving 15,204 units. Car and Driver praised the 2005 tC for its list of accessories but criticized its low headroom in the
					backseat and limited cargo room.</p>
